## To run the server:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the "backend" directory of the project.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
npm install
4. Start the server using nodemon with the following command:
nodemon app


## To run the client:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the "frontend" directory of the project.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
npm install
4. Start the client in development mode with the following command:
npm run dev

Make sure to run the server and client in separate terminal sessions, or in the background, to keep both the backend and frontend of the application running simultaneously.

Note: Before running the server and client, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Also, ensure that the necessary configurations and environment variables are set up correctly for the server to work as expected.
